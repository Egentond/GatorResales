# This is our Readme

Our project allows students of the University of Florida to buy and sell student tickets. We noticed that before a lot of college events students who for some reason could not go to the event would try to sell their ticket by any means necessary in social media groupchats, through posters or through word of mouth. While at the same time other students would be looking to buy tickets. So our solution is this app allows students to post their tickets to the app for the price that they want to sell it for or bid off their ticket, allowing other students to buy a student ticket to the event at a reasonable price.
